Title: Update to the Signing Process for Signing Groups
Paragraph: Signing Groups enable you to send an envelope to a predefined group of recipients and
				have any one member of the group sign your documents. When you send an envelope to a
				Signing Group, any one member of the group can open it and sign it with their own
				signature.
Paragraph: We will begin ramping in early December and conclude in January. We are introducing a new step
				for signers to improve awareness of the signer's role in the process. A new modal
				will now be displayed to the first member of the group who accesses the
				envelope:

				accountability and streamline the signing experience for all group members.
