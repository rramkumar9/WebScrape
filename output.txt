This
                        publication applies to the Demo and Production releases for December 2024,
                        version 24.4.00.00.All datacenters have been deployed for this Production
        release.
The following changes have been made to this document since its initial release:
Organization-Level Connect (OLC) is a true enterprise feature that offers the
                        following benefits:
OLC provides a centralized platform for efficiently managing all of your
                        Connect configurations. It helps streamline your operations, improve
                        compliance standards, and enhance productivity.
Use cases include:
We are branding our emails to align with the launch of Intelligent Agreement Management. You
				will notice the following updates to our email colors and icons that enhance the
				overall look and feel:
This is what our standard emails will look like:
As part of the company-wide branding effort, we are rolling out the new brand colors
				to the web application. In the beginning of December, colors and fonts on thePreparepage will be updated. This is purely a visual
				change and there are no functional changes being rolled out as part of this
				update.
With this enhancement, the Data Verification phone field group will
                            provide a dropdown of country calling codes. Signers will now be able to
                            select a country from a pre-populated list. This offers a better signing
                            experience, and helps reduce verification errors.
Twilio is a new extension app for Data Verification. Twilio’s real-time email address
				validation service improves deliverability by checking email addresses against a
				global database before you use them.
This validation service reduces document errors, not-in-good-order (NIGO) rates, and
				post-signature verification costs. With trillions of phone and email transactions
				per year, Twilio is a globally trusted customer engagement platform. Customers with
				access to Basic Data Verification will be able to use the Twilio app in eSignature
				at no extra cost.
You can download the Twilio app from theDocusignApp Center.
Data verification field groups can contain both required and optional
				fields. With this enhancement, all required fields in a group are protected and
				cannot be deleted. This change ensures that verifications receive the necessary data
				to complete without errors.
Required fields in a verification group are indicated by a red asterisk. For example,
				the verification group forPostal Addresscontains both
				required and optional fields. In this group, “Address Line 2” is optional; the
				preparer can delete this field after adding the group to their document. However,
				the remaining fields are all required and cannot be deleted.
This enhancement is available now in both Demo and Production accounts.
The URL to sign envelopes with the eSignature web application is changing in
                        the Demo and Production environments.
Customers accessing the application using the old URLs will be automatically
                        redirected to the new ones.
The updated URLs are expected to be live for all Demo customers by the end of
                        October, and for all Production customers between November and February. The
                        exceptions to this are customers using embedded signing and IL-4
                        customers.
Docusignis updating the Identity Verification user interface and
				page layout to make it easier to view and manage identity verification
				configurations. These changes appear for all account administrators usingDocusignID Verification and ID Verification Premier by December
				11, 2024.
The changes include:
A new template-like selection page for choosing the IDV method and signature
						type.
A more compact identity verification settings page layout with collapsible
						sections and tabs for selecting countries, ID types, and the ID evidence to
						store.
Options to search for identity verification configurations and filter by
						status.
We are updating the SMS templates to reduce spam perception and enhance signer
				engagement.  These improvements include the following:
The number of static characters has been reduced from 59 to 33.
The sender name has been removed to provide more space for key variable
						details like thecompany nameanddocument name.
This modernization ensures messages appear more relevant and trustworthy to signers,
				enabling faster recognition and action. These updates are designed to help signers
				complete their envelopes more quickly and increase overall completion rates.
{Sender Name} from {Company Name} has sent you aDocusigndocument
										“{Document Name}” to view and sign: {Envelope URL}
{Sender Name} from {Company Name} has CC-ed you onDocusigndocument “{Document Name}”:
										{Envelope URL}
{Sender Name} from {Company Name} has sent you aDocusigndocument “{Document Name}” to
										review: {Envelope URL}
Docusign: {companyName} sent you
										“{documentName}” to sign: {Envelope URL}
Docusign: {companyName} CC-ed you on
										“{agreementName}”: {Envelope URL}
Docusign: {companyName} sent you
										“{agreementName}” to review: {Envelope URL}
The SMS message from the updated template would look similar to the
							following:
Signing Groups enable you to send an envelope to a predefined group of recipients and
				have any one member of the group sign your documents. When you send an envelope to a
				Signing Group, any one member of the group can open it and sign it with their own
				signature.
We will begin ramping in early December and conclude in January. We are introducing a new step
				for signers to improve awareness of the signer's role in the process. A new modal
				will now be displayed to the first member of the group who accesses the
				envelope:
This modal provides two key improvements to the signing process:
Informs the signer that they are the first one in the signing group to access
						the envelope.
Presents the member with a confirmation prompt, allowing them to continue and
						assign the envelope to themselves.
This enhancement helps group members understand the signing process by explicitly
				indicating that they are choosing to sign the envelope for the Signing Group. By
				ensuring that the first signer acknowledges their role in this process, we enhance
				accountability and streamline the signing experience for all group members.
